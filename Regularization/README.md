---

Application of two regularization methods for deep neural networks;

* L_2 regularization
* Dropout regularization


## Packages

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a library to plot graphs in Python.
* [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/) is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
