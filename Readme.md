## Packages

The following librairies are needed in almost all codes in this repository: 

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a library to plot graphs in Python.
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. 
* [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/) is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
